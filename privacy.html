        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: January 04, 2026</p>

        <p><strong>ULG</strong> built the <strong>AOM</strong> (Android Outline Manager) app as an Ad-supported app.
            This SERVICE is provided by ULG at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

        <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of
            Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally
            identifiable information. However, the core functionality of this app focuses on managing servers locally.
        </p>

        <h3>1.1. User-Provided Data (Local)</h3>
        <p>The application manages Outline Server credentials (API URLs) and Access Keys. This data is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stored Locally:</strong> All server URLs and keys are stored securely on your device (Shared
                Preferences).</li>
            <li><strong>Not Shared:</strong> We (the developer) do not have access to your server credentials, keys, or
                metrics. They are never sent to our external servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2. Third-Party Data Collection (AdMob)</h3>
        <p>The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. We use
            <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use the following data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device IDs (Advertising ID)</li>
            <li>Coarse Location</li>
            <li>App performance data (Crash logs, diagnostics)</li>
            <li>Other usage data for advertising purposes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Link to privacy policy of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=my" target="_blank">AdMob</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Log Data</h2>
        <p>We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the app, we collect data
            and information (through third-party products like Google Play Services) on your phone called Log Data. This
            Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name,
            operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your
            use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>

        <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
        <p>This Service does not explicitly use these “cookies” for its core features. However, the app may use
            third-party code and libraries (such as AdMob) that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their
            services.</p>

        <h2>4. Service Providers</h2>
        <p>We rely on the Outline Manager API protocols to fetch server statistics. The app acts solely as a client
            interface for your own Outline servers.</p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information (Server Credentials), thus we are striving to
            use commercially acceptable means of protecting it within the device storage. But remember that no method of
            transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot
            guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
            information from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically
            for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at <a
